# map-route-animation

• Create a Mapbox account and get the access token

• Add the access token to the mapboxgl instance defined in the mapanimation.js

• Create a marker and add it to the map using the mapboxgl pre-built functions.

• The function move() is called when the button "Show stops between MIT and Harvard" is selected. This is how you can start the marker animation.

• If your code works, you should be able to see a marker moving from one bus stop to the next on the map.
